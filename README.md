# biomassSensorPy
a biomass sensor that utilizes the adafruit RGB color sensor https://www.adafruit.com/product/1334 as a way to detect if bacteria are growing in a flask.

The system consists of two basic components:
1. Raspberry pi-containing box that reads the sensors and hosts a webpage for looking at their data output
2. The sensor peripheral, which is attached to your culture vessel
